    <h1> CALABAR IS MY FAVOURITE CITY</h1>

    Calabar is a historic and culturally rich city in southern Nigeria, known for its lush
    greenery,
    warm hospitality, and deep roots in tradition. Once a major trading port, the city blends
    colonial-era architecture with vibrant local life, colorful markets, and lively festivals.
    Calabar
    is especially famous for its annual Carnival Calabar, often called “Africa’s biggest street
    party,”
    which fills the city with music, dance, and celebration. Surrounded by rivers and
    rainforest, it has
    a calm, welcoming atmosphere that sets it apart from many larger Nigerian cities.</p>
